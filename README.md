# Toxicty-classifier
This is a webpage-webserver combination designed to classify Instagram comments or phrases based on their toxicity levels.

# How to use the classifier
**You can detect the toxicity of individual phrases or the toxicity of the first few comments on the latest post of any public Instagram account.**

**The toxicity of each comment (or the phrase that you enter) will be displayed in the table below.**

**Each phrase or comment will be classified based on different factors listed in the columns.**

The classifier works in multiple languages. Please keep in mind that **the analysis of the comments may take a few seconds.**
